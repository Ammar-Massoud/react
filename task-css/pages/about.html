            A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs . 
            The source code for a simple computer program written in the C programming language. 
            The gray lines are comments that help explain the program to humans in a natural language. When compiled and run, it will give the output "Hello, world!".
            A programming language is described by its syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). It gets its basis from formal languages.
            a program usually has at least one implementation in the form of a compiler or interpreter, allowing programs written in the language to be executed.
            Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.
